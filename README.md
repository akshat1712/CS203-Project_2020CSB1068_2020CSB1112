Project of CS203  <br/>
This project is part of Academic Course , CS203 - Digital Logic and Design , Academic Year : 2021-22 , Fall Semester( August - December ) in Indian Insititute of Technology, Ropar , India  
Files with commit message "Final_commit_message" are final files required for Final submission of the project  
  
 In this project, we have implemented a spaceship game on FPGA  
 In this game, 3 consecutive led will glow out of 16 led present on the board , these 3 led's can move in linear order or in pseudo-random order depending upon the game mode.
 There are 16 switches from which you can shoot ( togging the switch to on condition ) and if position of led's of switch match, we get a point otherwise if user mishit, one point is deducted. Range of points is from 0-99 , we also display current score in this game and maximum score obtained in this simulation until now.
